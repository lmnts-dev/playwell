After the holiday season was over she would toss aside her new Barbies to go play with her brother's new LEGO sets.  This interest in building, as well as sciences and mathematics, led her to getting a BS in Architectural Engineering from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, CA.  After getting her Professional Engineer's license and working in the structural engineering field around San Francisco for 14 years, she decided that it was time for a change and desired to work in K-8 education.  This brought her to Play-Well, her new found dream job.  Aside from work, she enjoys volunteering for the various organizations in her two children's lives and playing with their family LEGO collection.  Her hobbies include working on needlepoint, reading books on philosophy/psychology, and practicing mindfulness and meditation.  For the future, she dreams of living on a farm."
