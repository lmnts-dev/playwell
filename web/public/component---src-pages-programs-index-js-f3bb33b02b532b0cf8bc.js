Generally a workshop will consist of two or three projects.\\r\\n","course_type_name":"Engineering Workshop with LEGOÂ® Materials","course_type_group":"Advanced","age_range_start":5,"age_range_end":9,"age_range_display":"Ages 5 - 9","date_time_display":"Sep 21st - Sep 21st, 2019 : 10:00 am - 12:00 pm","category_group_name":"Workshop","days_of_the_week":"Saturday","omit_dates":null,"public_note":"","room":null,"course_web_publishing_action_type_id":"2","action_url":"https://apm.activecommunities.com/allentxparks/Home?","is_restricted_registration":"0","email_registration_description":null,"phone_registration_description":null,"action_url_comment":null,"course_web_publishing_action_type":"Register.Client","action_type":"register","action_url_external":true}]}},{"node":{"id":"2997","display_address":"15201 Meridian Ave N, Shoreline, WA 98133","geocode_address":"15201 Meridian Ave N, Shoreline, WA 98133, USA","public_note":"","location_lng":-122.3345333,"location_lat":47.739049,"client_location_name":"The Evergreen School","courses":[{"course_id":81144,"is_full":0,"start_date":"2019-09-27","end_date":"2019-12-06","course_type_long_description":"Tap into your imagination with tens of thousands of LEGOÂ® parts!
