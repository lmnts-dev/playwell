Explore concepts in physics, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, and architecture while playing with your favorite creations.  Utilizing thousands of LEGO® parts, we strive to build students' problem-solving skills, foster a greater appreciation of how things work, and encourage the qualities of inquisitiveness, self-reliance, and self-confidence in children.  Projects for the workshop will be selected by the instructor based on the ages, experience levels, and interests of the children.  Generally a workshop will consist of two or three projects.\r\n","course_type_name":"Engineering Workshop with LEGO® Materials","course_type_group":"Advanced","age_range_start":5,"age_range_end":12,"age_range_display":"Grades K - 6","date_time_display":"Oct 26th - Oct 26th, 2019 : 9:00 am - 12:00 pm","category_group_name":"Workshop","days_of_the_week":"Saturday","omit_dates":null,"room":null,"course_web_publishing_action_type_id":"2","action_url":"https://isd194.ce.eleyo.com/","is_restricted_registration":"0","email_registration_description":null,"phone_registration_description":null,"action_url_comment":null,"course_web_publishing_action_type":"Register.Client","action_type":"register","action_url_external":true,"theme":"Advanced"}}}
