Tyler’s favorite hobby is working on cars or just fixing things, he loves to tinker. He grew up in Loomis, CA and as a kid most loved playing outside with his brothers and sisters. He now lives in Vacaville and spends most of his time managing our growing programs in Solano County, teaching our programs all over the area including Contra Costa County, and spending time with his family outdoors for fun. When he isn’t doing that, he dreams of building race cars and overlanding trucks.","id":"tmoulton","img":"https://pwpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/img/leadership/tmoulton.png","mgr_level":"assistant","name":"Tyler Moulton","title":"Solano"},{"bio":"Brian was born and raised in Santa Ana, CA and graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in Architecture. In college, he especially loved designing buildings and everything that came along with that (drawing floor plans, 3D modeling on computer programs and making real life scale models). His love of building models is so great that he now spends spare time building Gundam, Dragonball Z and other scale models of his favorite childhood cartoons/robots. As a kid he loved playing sports as well as video games. He is a self described \'huge nerd\' who loves most things to do with superheroes, anime, robots, and anything that keeps him a kid at heart. One day, he dreams of having an architecture firm or designing incredible buildings and possibly designing/opening up his own brewery.","id":"boliva","img":"https://pwpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/img/leadership/boliva2.png","mgr_level":"assistant","name":"Brian Oliva","title":"Alameda"}]}}]}}}')},434:function(e,a,i){"use strict";i(42);var n=i(433),t=i(0),o=i.n(t),r=(i(72),i(12),i(13)),s=i(3),l=i.n(s),d=(i(148),i(1)),h=i(2),c=l.a.div.withConfig({displayName:"stylesscss__TeamStyle",componentId:"r5a6xk-0"})([".team-container{display:flex;flex-direction:row;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:",";@media (max-width:","){justify-content:center;padding-top:calc("," / 2);}.member{text-align:center;margin-bottom:calc("," / 2);padding-right:calc("," / 8);width:16.66%;@media (max-width:","){width:20%;}@media (max-width:","){width:25%;}@media (max-width:","){width:33.33%;}p{font-weight:700;color:",";padding-bottom:0;line-height:1;&:last-of-type{color:",";}}.image-container{border-radius:calc("," / 8);margin:0 calc("," / 12) calc("," / 6) calc("," / 12);width:100%;height:0;padding-top:140%;position:relative;img{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-position:50% 50%;object-fit:cover;}}.social{display:flex;flex-direction:row;justify-content:center;padding-top:calc("," / 8);a{background-color:grey;border-radius:50%;display:block;height:calc("," / 2);width:calc("," / 2);svg{height:100%;width:100%;}}}}}"],(function(e){return e.Justify?e.Justify:"flex-start"}),h.a.Media.Width.Md+"px",d.a.Size,d.a.Size,d.a.Size,h.a.Media.Width.Lg+"px",h.a.Media.Width.Md+"px",h.a.Media.Width.Sm+"px",d.b.Color.Dino,d.b.Color.Sunset,d.a.Size,d.a.Size,d.a.Size,d.a.Size,d.a.Size,d.a.Size,d.a.Size);a.a=function(e){e.members;var a=e.Justify;return o.a.createElement(r.b,{query:"1024612912",render:function(e){return o.a.createElement(c,{Justify:a},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"team-container"},e.allDataJson.edges[1].node&&e.allDataJson.edges[1].node.leadership.map((function(e,a){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"member",key:a},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"image-container"},o.a.createElement("img",{src:e.img,alt:"Picture of "+e.name})),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.name),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.mgr_level),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"social"}))}))))},data:n})}}}]);
